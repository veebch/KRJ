# KRJ (Kenny Rogers Jukebox)

A Simple Proof Of Concept for triggering workflows upon payment of a Lightning Invoice. It was written to ping lnd on an Umbrel node on the LAN. When it sees that a pending invoice has been paid, it triggers something.

# Usage

Edit the config.yaml file to include the macaroon for your instance of lnd. If you are using a similar display, install [IT8951](https://github.com/GregDMeyer/IT8951).

There are tons of other (far better) ways to do this, but it illustrates the simplicity, speed and flexibility of using Lightning as a payment mechanism.
